# Research Library

This directory captures technical research for CRM114.

- `index.md` lists every published study.
- Individual markdown files dive deep on architecture, security, installer design, and related topics.
- `AGENTS.md` documents expectations for research artifacts (structure, tone, cross-linking).

Whenever new research is added or existing findings change, update both `index.md` and this README so GitHub/file browsers give contributors the latest map of available knowledge.
