# Documentation

- Provide session and architectural notes focused on Go services, packages, and binaries.
- Link architecture discussions to Go modules and packages.
- Capture Go build, test, and deployment procedures in detail.
- Record research findings in `docs/research/` with professional, deeply-structured Markdown targeted at Go developers and agents.
- Keep `docs/research/index.md` updated as the canonical table of contents for all research artifacts.
- Reflect plan completion requirements in documentation when referencing session outcomes, noting any `## Won't Do` decisions.
- Include research summaries and references to docs/research artifacts within session debriefs and user responses.
- Ensure every directory under `docs/` maintains a human-facing `README.md` describing its contents; update affected READMEs whenever files in that directory change in material ways.
