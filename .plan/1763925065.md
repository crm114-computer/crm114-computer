_Request timestamp: 1763925065_

## Tasks
- [x] Update AGENTS.md with README creation/maintenance rules

- [x] Ensure existing directories have README.md (create or update as needed)
- [x] Re-run go tests after documentation changes
- [x] Update session index and plan metadata (Won't Do / Debrief)
- [x] Capture git activity summary and ensure branch naming policy followed

## Won't Do
- [ ] None (all tasks completed).

## Debrief
- **AGENTS.md updated**: Added explicit requirement to author/update README.md files for every directory, with emphasis on refreshing when files change.
- **Directory guidance**: Updated `.plan/AGENTS.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`, and created `.plan/README.md`, `docs/research/README.md`, `internal/app/README.md`, `tests/README.md` to ensure GitHub/file browsers show explanations.
- **Repository README**: Expanded root `README.md` with repository map and testing instructions to reflect new doc structure.
- **Tests**: `go test ./...` → pass (crm114/internal/app, cached).
- **Git Activity**: Working on branch `session-1763925065-readme-policy`; commits pending for README policy changes.
