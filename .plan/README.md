# Session Planning Directory

This directory contains every CRM114 session plan:

- `index.md` links to each session, named by request timestamp.
- each `TIMESTAMP.md` file tracks the checklist, Won't Do decisions, and Debrief for that session.
- `AGENTS.md` documents process requirements for planning artifacts.

Maintain this README whenever new planning conventions are introduced or the structure changes, so GitHub/file-browser previews explain how to navigate active and historical plans.
