## Won't Do
- [ ] Establish Go module + passing tests during this review — requires follow-up implementation session; tracked previously and remains blocked until new development work begins.

## Debrief
- **Review AGENTS.md**: Re-read current instructions covering planning, git, testing, research, and response protocols.
- **Analyze historical compliance**: Assessed session-1 artifacts; identified partial compliance (planning/research good, response/TDD lacking) and documented variances in research report.
- **Document findings**: Authored `docs/research/agents-compliance-review.md` with detailed tables, root causes, remediation plan, test status, and git summary; indexed in `docs/research/index.md`.
- **Update index**: Session index now links "AGENTS Compliance Review" entry.
- **Update plan metadata**: Added Won't Do for outstanding Go module/tests and Debrief summarizing tasks, tests, git activity.
- **Summarize git activity**: Noted branch `session-2` creation, prior branch commits, and absence of merges due to failing tests.
- **Remediation coding/tests**: Initialized Go module `crm114`, created `internal/app` package with Greeting stub, wrote `app_test.go`, and ran `go test ./...` successfully.
- **Branch policy update**: Added session-exclusive branch naming guidance (`session-<timestamp>-<focus>`) to AGENTS.md and .plan/AGENTS.md; current branch `session-1763923696-branch-policy` documents compliance.
- **Tests**: `go test ./...` → **pass** (package crm114/internal/app, 0.014s).
- **Git Activity**: Branch `session-1763923696-branch-policy` active for this update. Prior branch `session-2` remains for compliance review history. Existing commits on `session-1`: `465d19c`, `79c0659`, `8ced233`, `9162c5c`, `1c1a22c`, `c62d2b8`, `6b0f492`; current branch contains new commit (pending). No merges to `main` yet.
