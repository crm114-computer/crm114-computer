_Request timestamp: 1763923696_

## Tasks
- [x] Review AGENTS.md instructions in detail
- [x] Analyze historical compliance of previous session(s) against AGENTS.md
- [x] Document findings in docs/research directory per protocol
- [x] Update .plan/index.md with this session's descriptive title
- [x] Update session checklist/Won't Do/Debrief with results and blockers
- [x] Summarize git activity and merge status for this review

## Won't Do
- [ ] Establish Go module + passing tests during this review — requires follow-up implementation session; tracked previously and remains blocked until new development work begins.

## Debrief
- **Review AGENTS.md**: Re-read current instructions covering planning, git, testing, research, and response protocols.
- **Analyze historical compliance**: Assessed session-1 artifacts; identified partial compliance (planning/research good, response/TDD lacking) and documented variances in research report.
- **Document findings**: Authored `docs/research/agents-compliance-review.md` with detailed tables, root causes, remediation plan, test status, and git summary; indexed in `docs/research/index.md`.
- **Update index**: Session index now links "AGENTS Compliance Review" entry.
- **Update plan metadata**: Added Won't Do for outstanding Go module/tests and Debrief summarizing tasks, tests, git activity.
- **Summarize git activity**: Noted branch `session-2` creation, prior branch commits, and absence of merges due to failing tests.
- **Tests**: `go test ./...` (fails: no Go module yet; recorded under Won't Do as blocker for TDD/merge requirements).
- **Git Activity**: Branch `session-2` created for this review. Existing commits on `session-1`: `465d19c`, `79c0659`, `8ced233`, `9162c5c`, `1c1a22c`, `c62d2b8`, `6b0f492`. No merges to `main` while tests failing.
