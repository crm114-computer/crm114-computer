# Planning Foundations Setup

_Request timestamp: 1763917478_

## Tasks
- [x] Author root AGENTS.md with build protocol instructions
- [x] Initialize docs/ structure and AGENTS.md
- [x] Initialize .plan workflow docs
- [x] Update AGENTS.md with Go-specific workflow guidance
- [x] Update directory AGENTS files and docs to emphasize Go usage
- [x] Ensure planning artifacts reference Go deliverables
- [x] Document docs/research workflow in AGENTS instructions
- [x] Create docs/research directory with AGENTS and research index

## Won't Do
- [ ] Create Go-based tooling/tests enforcing Go-focused instructions — blocked until Go module exists; awaiting user direction on initial module scope.
- [ ] Initialize Go module metadata for verification tests — requires confirmation of module path/package naming.
- [ ] Add Go tests covering research instructions and structure — depends on module initialization; will implement once Go test harness is established.
- [ ] Keep docs/research/index.md up to date — future operational task once research docs exist (currently index lists single research artifact).

## Debrief
- **Author root AGENTS.md**: Established Go-focused protocol with planning, research, response, git, and merge requirements, including new Response Protocol.
- **Initialize docs/ structure and AGENTS.md**: Created docs/ hierarchy with README/AGENTS detailing Go documentation scope and research expectations.
- **Initialize .plan workflow docs**: Added .plan/index.md, session file, and directory AGENTS clarifying checklist, Won't Do, and Debrief rules.
- **Update AGENTS.md with Go-specific workflow guidance**: Expanded instructions to enforce Go TDD, research workflows, git summaries, merge policies, and response content requirements.
- **Update directory AGENTS files and docs to emphasize Go usage**: Synced .plan/AGENTS.md, docs/AGENTS.md, and docs/README.md with Go-centric practices and research tracking.
- **Ensure planning artifacts reference Go deliverables**: Session plan now documents Go deliverables, research workflow, and git/test reporting expectations.
- **Document docs/research workflow in AGENTS instructions**: Added Research Protocol/Response Protocol sections and directory-level instructions.
- **Create docs/research directory with AGENTS and research index**: Added docs/research/AGENTS.md, docs/research/index.md, and initial research report on Charm stack + macOS hidden user SSH.
- **Won't Do items**: Deferred Go tooling/tests, module metadata, research test harness, and ongoing research index maintenance pending module scope decisions; documented above.
- **Tests**: `go test ./...` (fails: no Go module yet; blocked until module initialized — recorded under Won't Do).
- **Git Activity**: Branch `session-1` created from empty main. Commits chronologically: `465d19c` (planning/docs init), `79c0659` (descriptive plan titles), `8ced233` (Go-specific protocols), `9162c5c` (Go focus alignment), `1c1a22c` (research instructions), `c62d2b8` (plan completion rules). No merges to `main` yet due to pending Go module/tests.
